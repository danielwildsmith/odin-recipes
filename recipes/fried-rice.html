        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Leftover cooked white rice</li>
            <li>Frozen peas</li>
            <li>Shaoxing wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Your skillet can be non-stick or stainless steel, it really doesn’t matter. If you 
                have a favorite, use that one. I used canola oil to make my fried rice, but feel free to use olive oil if that’s all you have on-hand.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes I cook my eggs first, other times I cook them after I’ve sauteed the onion and veggies. For larger, fluffier curds, cook your eggs first 
                then remove to a clean plate to rest while the other ingredients are prepared. 
            </li>
            <li>Use a wooden spatula to scrape up any egg that may have stuck to your skillet and return to high heat. Add 1 more tablespoon of oil, the diced onion,
                and diced carrot. Cook, stirring often until the onions start to soften and turn lightly golden - approximately 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Mix well to combine and cook, stirring continuously, for 30 seconds. Fresh garlic and ginger will 
                burn if they’re left to cook, unattended, on a hot skillet. 
            </li>
            <li>Add in the cold rice and defrosted peas, mixing well to combine with the veggies and aromatics. Spread and gently press the rice into the pan and
                allow it to cook for approximately 30 seconds. Stir and repeat until rice is lightly golden (2-3 minutes total).
            </li>
            <li>Return the eggs to the pan and add the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and white pepper. Stir to combine. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with additional soy sauce, to taste, and garnish with green onions, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
